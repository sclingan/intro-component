## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned a lot on this project, form submission and typescript especially. First time really using typescript,
I had a rough time trying to figure out how to use correct
types in typescript and still accomplish my goal.




### Continued development

I would like to return to this project and make the backend part of the project. Use React router to render the trial details page, plus a shopping cart page to keep track of the 
order.

### Useful resources
